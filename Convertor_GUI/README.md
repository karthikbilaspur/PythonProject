Exponentiation: Calculates the square of a number.
Clear Entry Field: Clears the current entry field.
Delete Character: Deletes a character from the entry field.
Error Handling: Displays error messages for invalid input.
The program uses a menu-driven interface with buttons for each operation, making it easy to use and interact with.
Key Functions
calculate(): Evaluates the mathematical expression in the entry field.
memory_add() and memory_subtract(): Adds or subtracts values from memory.
memory_recall() and memory_clear(): Recalls or clears the memory value.
sqrt() and square(): Calculates the square root or square of a number.
Example Use Cases
