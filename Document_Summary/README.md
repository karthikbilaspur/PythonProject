# Document Analysis Toolkit: A GUI-Based Solution for Text Summarization, Entity Recognition, and Word Counting

Document Analyzer: This tool combines the features of the other two tools. It allows users to input text and then analyze it using three buttons:
"Analyze Document": Displays the detected words, entities, and nouns in the text.
"Count Words": Displays the total word count of the text.
"Generate Summary": Generates a summary of the text using a frequency-based approach.
Document Summary Generator: This tool generates a summary of the input text using a frequency-based approach. It tokenizes the text into sentences, calculates word frequencies, and scores sentences based on their word frequencies. The top-scoring sentences are selected to form the summary.
Document Word Detection: This tool detects words, entities, and nouns in the input text using spaCy's natural language processing capabilities. It displays the detected words, entities, and nouns in the text, and also allows users to count the total number of words.
All three tools use a GUI-based interface to interact with the user, and they display the output in a text area. The tools can be useful for tasks such as text summarization, entity recognition, and word counting.
