Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand user input and respond accordingly. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses defined in a JSON file.
Features
Intent Classification: Uses a neural network to classify user input into intents
Response Generation: Generates responses based on the classified intent
Customizable: Can be extended to support more intents and responses
Requirements
Python 3.x
nltk library (for text processing)
keras library (for deep learning)
pickle library (for data serialization)
json library (for data loading)
Installation
Clone the repository
Install the required libraries: pip install nltk keras pickle json
Download the NLTK data required for text processing: python -m nltk.downloader punkt
Usage
Create a JSON file named intents.json with the following format:
JSON
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["hello", "hi", "hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello! How can I assist you today?", "Hi there! What's on your mind?"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "goodbye",
      "patterns": ["bye", "see you later"],
      "responses": ["See you later! Have a great day!", "Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you."]
    }
  ]
}
Run the chatbot: python chatbot.py
Interact with the chatbot by typing messages
Example Use Cases
User: "hello"
Bot: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
User: "bye"
Bot: "See you later! Have a great day!"
