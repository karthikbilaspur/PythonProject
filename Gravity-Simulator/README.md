# Gravity Simulator

A Python script that simulates gravity between planets using Pygame.
Applies gravity between planets using the inverse square law.
Updates planet positions based on their velocities.
Draws planets on the screen with random properties.
Key Features
Random planet properties (position, mass, radius, color, velocity)
Gravity simulation using inverse square law
Boundary checking (planets bounce off edges)
Customizable gravity constant and simulation parameters
Potential Use Cases
Educational tool for demonstrating gravity and planetary motion
Research tool for simulating complex gravitational systems
Game development (e.g., space simulation games)
