# Facebook AutoLogin Script Summary

This Python script automates the Facebook login process using Selenium WebDriver. Here's a summary of how it works:
Requirements:
Install required modules using pip install -r requirements.txt
Replace `username@email.com` with your Facebook email/username
Replace password with your Facebook password
Run chromedriver.exe (a Chrome browser automation tool)
Run the Python script facebookAuto.py
How it works:
The script uses Selenium WebDriver to open Facebook's login page.
It enters the specified email/username and password into the login form.
The script submits the login form, automating the login process.
Note: Storing passwords in plain text is a security risk. This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities. Facebook's terms of service also prohibit automating login without permission.
