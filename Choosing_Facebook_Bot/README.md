# Facebook Bot Project
=====================

A Python-based Facebook bot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user messages.

## Features
------------

*   **NLP processing**: Uses NLTK to tokenize, lemmatize, and remove stop words from user messages.
*   **Customizable responses**: Allows you to define custom responses to user messages based on NLP processing.
*   **Facebook Messenger integration**: Uses the Facebook Messenger API to send and receive messages.
*   **Logging**: Logs errors and other events using the `logging` module.

## Requirements
---------------

*   Python 3.6 or later
*   `nltk` library for NLP processing
*   `requests` library for making HTTP requests
*   `flask` library for creating a web server
*   Facebook Developer account and Facebook App setup

## Setup
--------

1.  Clone the repository and install the required libraries using `pip`.
2.  Set up a Facebook App and obtain a Page Access Token.
3.  Update the `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `VERIFY_TOKEN` variables in the script.
4.  Run the script using `python`.

## Usage
-----

1.  Send a message to the Facebook Page associated with the App.
2.  The bot will respond to the message based on the NLP processing and custom responses.

## Customization
--------------

*   Update the `process_message` function to define custom responses to user messages.
*   Use NLTK to implement more advanced NLP techniques, such as entity recognition and sentiment analysis.
*   Integrate with external services (e.g., databases, APIs) to provide more informative responses.
