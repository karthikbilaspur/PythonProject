# Bag of Words Model README

This project implements a Bag of Words model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It takes user input text, preprocesses it, and creates a Bag of Words representation using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn. The resulting matrix is then converted to a pandas DataFrame and exported to an Excel file.
Requirements
Python 3.x
