This Python script uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails as spam or not spam. It:
Loads and preprocesses a dataset of labeled emails.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains a Naive Bayes model on the training data.
Evaluates the model using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Allows for classification of new emails.
Key Features:
Uses scikit-learn library for machine learning
Utilizes natural language processing techniques (tokenization, stopword removal)
Can be improved with larger datasets and advanced NLP techniques (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
