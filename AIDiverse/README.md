Project Description
This project is a chatbot built using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. It uses the spaCy library for entity recognition and the Keras library for building the neural network model.
Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:
Bash
pip install nltk keras spacy tkinter
Also, make sure to download the required NLTK data and spaCy models:
Python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
Usage
To use the chatbot, simply run the script and a GUI window will appear. You can then type messages in the input box and the chatbot will respond.
Features
Entity Recognition: The chatbot uses spaCy to recognize entities in user messages.
Intent Prediction: The chatbot uses a deep learning model to predict the intent behind user messages.
Response Generation: The chatbot generates responses based on the identified intent and entities.
