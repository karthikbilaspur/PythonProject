# 100 Doors Puzzle Summary

Problem Statement: 100 doors are initially closed. A person walks through all doors multiple times, toggling (opening or closing) doors based on specific rules. Determine which doors remain open after all iterations.
Solution: Doors with perfect square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, ...) remain open because they have an odd number of divisors, resulting in an odd number of toggles.
Key Concepts: Perfect squares, divisors, and toggle operations.
Code Summary
Python Implementation: A concise code snippet calculates the number of perfect squares less than or equal to n, representing the number of doors that remain open.
Enhanced Code: An improved version includes a simulation function, list comprehension, and clear variable names.
Advanced Code: A class-based structure, timing simulation, and assertion for verification are added for more complexity and insight.
Key Takeaways
The 100 Doors puzzle illustrates the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like perfect squares and divisors.
The solution can be efficiently implemented using Python, with opportunities for optimization and enhancement.
