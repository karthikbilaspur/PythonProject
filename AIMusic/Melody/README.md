Melody Generation Project
Overview
This project generates melodies using a Markov Chain transition matrix. The code defines a scale and chord progression, and uses a transition matrix to generate a melody based on probability distributions.
Features
Markov Chain-Based Melody Generation: The code uses a Markov Chain transition matrix to generate melodies based on probability distributions.
Customizable Scale and Chord Progression: The code allows users to define their own scale and chord progression.
Flexible Melody Length: The code allows users to specify the length of the generated melody.
Usage
Define the Scale and Chord Progression: Define the scale and chord progression as lists of notes (e.g., ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B'] and ['C', 'G', 'Am', 'F']).
Define the Transition Matrix: Define the transition matrix as a dictionary of dictionaries, where each key is a note and the value is a dictionary of probabilities for each possible next note.
Specify the Melody Length: Specify the length of the generated melody (e.g., 16).
Run the Code: Run the code to generate a melody based on the specified scale, chord progression, and transition matrix.
Code Structure
The code consists of a single function:
generate_melody: This function generates a melody based on the specified scale, chord progression, and transition matrix.
Example Output
The code will output a generated melody as a list of notes.
Code
['C', 'D', 'E', 'G', 'A', 'G', 'F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'G', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'G', 'F']
Future Development
Improve Transition Matrix: Improve the transition matrix to generate more complex and interesting melodies.
Add More Musical Features: Add more musical features, such as rhythm and harmony, to the generated melodies.
Integrate with Music Generation Tools: Integrate the code with music generation tools to produce complete musical compositions.
