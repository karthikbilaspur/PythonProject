# File Encryption

This script uses a combination of symmetric encryption (Fernet) and a password-based key derivation function (PBKDF2HMAC) to securely encrypt and decrypt files.
The script also includes an AI-powered password strength analyzer using a random forest classifier.
The AI model is trained on a dataset of passwords and can predict the strength of a given password.
The script provides a menu-driven interface for encrypting and decrypting files, as well as training the AI model.
Benefits:
Secure encryption using symmetric encryption and password-based key derivation
AI-powered password strength analysis
Menu-driven interface for easy use
