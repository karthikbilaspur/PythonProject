Bitwise Operations README
This script demonstrates the use of bitwise operators in Python.
Features
Performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift operations
Displays binary representation of numbers and results
Menu-driven interface for user input
Input validation for integers
Requirements
Python 3.x
Usage
Clone or download the repository.
Run the script using Python: python bitwise_operations.py
Follow the menu prompts to perform bitwise operations.
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise AND (&): Performs a binary AND operation on two integers.
Bitwise OR (|): Performs a binary OR operation on two integers.
Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a binary XOR operation on two integers.
Bitwise NOT (~): Performs a binary NOT operation on an integer.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of an integer to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of an integer to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result.
