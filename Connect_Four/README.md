# Code Snippet

Code Snippet 1: This code implements a Connect Four game with a Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making. The game is played between two players, with Player 1 being human and Player 2 being the AI. The AI uses a basic evaluation function to determine its moves.
Code Snippet 2: This code is similar to the first snippet but includes alpha-beta pruning in the Minimax algorithm for improved efficiency. The game logic and AI decision-making are similar, but the pruning optimizes the search process.
Code Snippet 3: This code creates a Connect Four game interface using Streamlit and integrates with LangChain's OpenAI LLM for generating responses. The game logic is basic, and the LLM provides suggestions or insights during the game.
Code Snippet 4: This code implements a simple Connect Four game without AI or advanced game logic. Two players take turns dropping pieces into the board, and the game checks for wins. The game is played in the command line.
