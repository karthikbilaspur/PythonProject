# Choosing_Detection_Color_Using_AI_and_GUI

This script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for detecting dominant colors in an image. The GUI allows users to:
Select an image: Browse for an image file
`Detect dominant colors:** Use K-means clustering to detect the dominant colors in the image
Display results: Show the dominant colors in a text box

The script uses:
Tkinter: For creating the GUI
OpenCV: For loading and processing the image
Scikit-learn: For performing K-means clustering

The script is useful for:
Color analysis: Detecting dominant colors in images
Image processing: Analyzing image color properties

Benefits:
Easy to use: Simple and intuitive GUI
Fast results: Quick detection of dominant colors
Customizable: Can be modified to suit specific needs

Requirements:
Python: With Tkinter, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn libraries installed
