# Face Detection and Recognition Script Summary

This script uses OpenCV and TensorFlow to detect faces, recognize individuals, and analyze facial expressions in images and video streams.

Key Features:
Face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier
Face recognition using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer
Facial expression analysis using a pre-trained TensorFlow model
Real-time face detection and recognition from camera feed
Image-based face detection and recognition

How it works:
The script detects faces in an image or video stream using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier.
The detected faces are then recognized using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer.
The facial expression of the detected faces is analyzed using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.

Applications:
Surveillance systems
Access control systems
Emotion-based analysis
Human-computer interaction.
