Project Description
This project is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird, where the bird is controlled by an artificial intelligence (AI) using a neural network. The game is built using Python and the Pygame library.
Installation
To run the game, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:
Bash
pip install pygame
Usage
To play the game, simply run the script:
Bash
python flappy_bird_ai.py
The game will start automatically, and the AI will control the bird.
Features
AI-controlled bird: The bird is controlled by a neural network that makes decisions based on the game's state.
Scorekeeping: The game keeps track of the score, which increases whenever the bird passes through a pipe.
Game Over screen: A "Game Over" screen is displayed when the game ends, showing the final score and high score.
AI Details
Neural network architecture: The neural network consists of a single layer with three inputs and two outputs.
Inputs: The inputs to the neural network are the bird's y position, the pipe's x position, and the pipe's y position.
Outputs: The outputs of the neural network determine whether the bird should flap or not.
