Lowercase letters: Passwords should contain at least one lowercase letter.
Numbers: Passwords should contain at least one number.
Special characters: Passwords should contain at least one special character.
Password Generator

Length: Passwords can be any length, but it's recommended to use at least 12 characters.
Uppercase letters: Passwords can include uppercase letters.
Numbers: Passwords can include numbers.
Special characters: Passwords can include special characters.

Security
This project is designed to be secure, but it's not foolproof. Please use caution when storing sensitive information.
Passwords are stored in plain text and are not encrypted.
The master password is hashed using SHA-256, but it's still vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
