# Discord Bots

These two code snippets are for Discord bots using Python. Here's a summary:
Bot 1: AI-Powered Chatbot
Uses transformers library and T5 model for natural language processing
Responds to user messages without a prefix
Has a !chat command to generate responses
Can engage in conversations with users
Bot 2: Fun and Utility Bot
Has various commands for fun and utility:
!ping: checks bot latency
!hello: says hello to the user
!roll: rolls a dice with optional sides parameter
!joke: generates a random joke
Has error handling for unknown commands
If you want to combine the two bots, you could integrate the AI-powered chatbot's functionality into the fun and utility bot, allowing users to interact with the bot using both commands and conversational language.
