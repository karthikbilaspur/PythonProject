Guess Game: Guess whether the dice roll will be higher or lower than your chosen number
Versions
GUI-Based Version: A graphical user interface that allows users to choose dice type and roll dice
Text-Based Version: A command-line interface that offers more features, such as rolling multiple dice and playing the guess game
Usage
Choose the version you prefer (GUI-based or text-based)

Guess Game Rules
Think of a number between 1 and the number of sides on the dice.
