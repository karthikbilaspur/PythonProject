A Q-learning agent implemented in Python to navigate the FrozenLake environment. The agent learns to reach the goal by trial and error, using a Q-table to store the expected return for each state-action pair.
Features
Q-Learning Algorithm: Implemented Q-learning algorithm to train the agent.
FrozenLake Environment: Used the FrozenLake environment from Gym library.
Reward Visualization: Plotted rewards over episodes to visualize the agent's performance.
Smoothed Rewards: Calculated and plotted smoothed rewards to show the agent's learning progress.
