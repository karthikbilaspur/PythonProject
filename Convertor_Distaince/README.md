# Calculate Distance

This program calculates the distance between two or more points in 2D or 3D space using the Euclidean distance formula. It includes the following features:
Distance Calculation: Calculates the distance between two points or multiple points.
Unit Conversion: Converts the distance to different units (km, miles, meters).
Multiple Point Calculation: Calculates the distances between multiple points.
The program uses a menu-driven interface, allowing users to:
Calculate distance between two points
Calculate distances between multiple points
Convert units
Key Functions
calculate_distance(point1, point2): Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.
calculate_multiple_distances(points): Calculates the distances between multiple points.
convert_units(distance, unit): Converts the distance to a different unit.
Example Use Cases
Calculating the distance between two points in 2D or 3D space.
Calculating the distances between multiple points in 2D or 3D space.
Converting the distance to a different unit (km, miles, meters).
