Overview
A Streamlit application that uses machine learning to predict crop labels based on input parameters such as N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
Features
Crop Label Prediction: Predicts crop labels based on input parameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using classification report.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input parameters and view predictions.
Installation
Clone the repository or download the code.
Install required libraries: streamlit, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn.
Run the application using streamlit run app.py.
Usage
Enter the parameter values (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall) in the input fields.
Click on the "Predict" button ( implicit, happens when you input values) to view the predicted crop label.
View the model's performance metrics.
