# Digital Clock

The DigitalClock class creates a GUI window with labels to display the time, date, and alarm.
The update_time method gets the current time and date using time.strftime and updates the labels.
The set_alarm method sets the alarm time based on user input.
When the current time matches the alarm time, a message is displayed.
You can run this code to see the enhanced digital clock in action!
Customization
You can change the font, color, and size of the labels to suit your preferences.
You can also add additional features, such as multiple alarms or a snooze button.
