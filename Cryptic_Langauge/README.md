# Cryptic Language Script Summary

This Python script demonstrates two cryptic language techniques:
Caesar Cipher: Shifts each letter in the text by a specified value for encryption and decryption.
Vigenère Cipher: Uses a key to shift each letter in the text for encryption and decryption.
The script provides a menu-driven interface for users to:
Encrypt and decrypt text using Caesar Cipher
Encrypt and decrypt text using Vigenère Cipher
This script showcases basic encryption and decryption techniques, but keep in mind that these methods are not suitable for secure communication in production environments.
