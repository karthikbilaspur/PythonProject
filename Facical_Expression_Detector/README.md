# Facial Expression Recognition Code Summary

This code uses OpenCV and TensorFlow to recognize facial expressions in real-time video capture.
Key Features:
Loads a pre-trained facial expression recognition model
Detects faces using a cascade classifier
Extracts face ROI and predicts facial expression
Displays the recognized facial expression on the video frame
Code Improvements:
Error handling for model loading and prediction
Validation for face detection and expression index
Code organization into functions for better readability and reusability
Potential Issues:
Model not found or incorrect predictions
Face detection failure or incorrect ROI extraction
Expression index out of range or invalid predictions.
